## Rational Paranoia
The homework specifications, as well as the corresponding course slide decks,
can be found on the course canvas.

You will do this homework by editing the _README.md_ file. It's in
[MarkDown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
and will be rendered to beautiful HTML when you visit your GitHub repo.

## Student Information
Please also edit _README.md_ and replace your instructor's name and NetID with your own:

_Student name_: Tanya Jagan

_Student NetID_: tj17

Your NetID is typically your initials and a numeric digit. That's
what we need here.

_If you contacted us in advance and we approved a late submission,
please cut-and-paste the text from that email here._

## Problem 1
- Scenario: You are managing the security of checked luggage at Houston Intercontinental Airport.
- Assumptions:
  - The luggage has been scanned for dangerous materials by TSA agents. 
- Assets:
  - Passengers' belongings (getting stolen or misplaced).
  - Passengers' privacy (access to their luggage).
  - Belongings being tampered with or damaged.
- Threats:
  - Airport security employees insider threat.
  - Other passengers taking luggage that does not belong to them.
  - Damage during transport or mishandling.
- Countermeasures:
  - Vetting airport security employees for previous criminal history, the cost of this would be high as you'd need to hire investigators but the benefit would be to have more trust in employees.
  - Adding cameras in areas where luggage is handled or transported, this would include the cost of buying, installing and managing cameras. It also requires additional personnel to be monitoring the cameras and making sure safety and privacy protocols are followed. The benefit would be that employees and other passengers will be more cognizant of what they do.
  - Giving passengers a unique code that matches their luggage that must be checked in order to pick up the luggage. This would also require additional personnel to be handing out luggage than the current system of people taking their luggage off of the belt. However, the benefit would be that nobody gains access to luggage that is not their own.

## Problem 2
- Scenario: As the recently-hired CISO of Sony, you set intellectual property protection procedures.
- Assumptions:
  - Sony employees come up with ideas and work on them on digital blueprints and other digital documents only.
  - Sony has a supply chain of factories and workers globally who work on individual components that make Sony products.
  - Sony products have software in them that allows it to function correctly.
- Assets:
  - Sony products and their blueprints.
  - Sony employees' ideas.
  - Supply chain contacts.
  - Sony product software.
- Threats:
  - Leaking new product blueprints (others would reproduce them).
  - Leaking supply chain contacts (attackers could meddle with a part of the supply chain to stop Sony from being able to build their products).
  - Sony products being hacked and the code to the software being exposed (stolen or meddled with).
  - Employees ideas getting stolen by peers outside of Sony (social media or friends).
- Countermeasures:
  - Have strict security measures like requiring 2-factor authentication for employees to access or work on blueprints and don't allow them to print or download (to their personal devices) anything from Sony networks. This includes the cost of 2-factor authentication and whatever software is necessary to restrict print/download access but the benefit would be that blueprints will be much less likely to go outside of Sony premises.
  - Have a strict code of conduct agreement requiring employees to not share anything they do or create at Sony on social media, with friends, or with family. This doesn't include any costs and if an employee is found to have broken this agreement, Sony can possibly sue them for the cost of the product.
  - Bind supply chain contacts with the same code of conduct agreement in which they do not share that they are working on Sony products with anyone so there is less of a chance attackers will find them. Again, cost is minimal and the benefit would be greater trust. 

## Problem 3
- Scenario: Managing security at Rice publics.
- Assumptions:
  - Students have their Rice IDs.
  - Rice publics happen in college commons, which has access to dorms and furniture.
- Assets:
  - Commons furniture.
  - Commons technology/electrical/water/other resources.
  - Student dorms and belongings.
  - Rice students.
- Threats:
  - Attendees stealing furniture or tampering with technology/electrical/water/other resources that could cause outages or other damage to the college as a whole.
  - Attendees gaining access to dorm floors and/or dorm rooms.
  - Non-Rice students coming in with a fake Rice ID.
  - Overcrowding causing EMS to not get access to sick attendees when needed.
- Countermeasures:
  - Managing the flow of traffic by placing student volunteers to guide people in and out. This would come with little cost since students already volunteer at events for service hours, and the benefit would be that EMS or other medical/police folk could gain access easily and be directed to where they need to be.
  - Volunteers patrolling the commons to break up big crowds and make sure people who seem sick are taken to less crowded areas. Again, cost is very little and the benefit would be constant surveillance and maximizing the potential of sick students being out in the open.
  - Have attendees swipe into colleges to see if their badges work to make sure they aren't fake Rice IDs. This would also be low cost since there are already ID scanners all over campus, and the benefit would be that only real Rice IDs would be let in.
  - Closing off access to dorm floors for anyone not living in the building and having security to check a list of that dorm's residents when letting people in and out. Again, the cost is having a student volunteer and the benefit is restricted access.
  - Remove any important furniture from common spaces so attendees don't have access to them. The cost again would be having volunteers move them.
  
## Problem 4

For each of the following statements, give an example of a
situation in which the statement is true (or, if you prefer, where
at least some real-world people seem to believe that this statement
is true; explain why they're wrong).

  - Prevention is more important than detection and recovery: corporations protecting their business ideas because if the information has to be detected and recovered, it is already leaked and stolen, so prevention is more important.
  
  - Detection is more important than prevention and recovery: military situations where spies need to be detected. Prevention is important but having baits to lure other spies in and detect them can be beneficial for the country as a whole to gain information on their opponents.
  
  - Recovery is more important than prevention and detection: personal finance case where your money gets stolen, all that really matters is getting your money back. Prevention and detection are also important but the most important would be recovery because no damage is done once it is recovered.
  
  - Authentication is more important than prevention, detection, or recovery: access to personal/private systems (such as large corporation databases) that can be tampered with if accessed by the wrong person. 
  
  - Availability is more important than prevention, detection, or recovery: health accounts that are necessary to order medications, it needs to be available even after multiple incorrect passwords because locking it as a form of prevention would cause someone to not have their possibly life saving medication available.
